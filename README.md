# Notes / Statistics
I used multiple bots over a few days, which is really quite excessive, to gather all this data. Using concepts from the “coupon collector” (statistics) problem, it is over 99% likely that I have seen every unique word at least once.

# Sorting

Files will be labeled and sorted with "alphabetical" or "drawability".

- Alphabetical order sorts the entire list.
- Drawability breaks up the list into seperate sections for different word patterns and for each, it uses AI to subjectively sort by how easy it is to be drawn in a game like skribbl.io. (not super good right now)
